# FORGED-LRO — CANON v1.0

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Scope:** Core Engine, RVA, All Verticals  
**Applies To:** Specifications, Schemas, and Implementations

---

## 1. Purpose of the Canon

This document defines the **non-negotiable constants, rules, and invariants**
governing the FORGED-LRO system.

The Canon exists to:

- Eliminate ambiguity
- Prevent silent protocol mutation
- Enforce deterministic behavior
- Provide a single source of truth (SSOT)
- Enable external auditability

Any system claiming **FORGED-LRO compliance** MUST adhere to this Canon.

---

## 2. Canonical Statement

All operations reduce to the following invariant statement:

> **Data D (hash H) was registered by entity E at timestamp T (UTC)**

No other claims are permitted at the protocol level.

---

## 3. Core Cryptographic Constants (Immutable)

The following constants are fixed for Canon v1.0:

- **Hash Algorithm:** SHA-256
- **Signature Algorithm:** Ed25519
- **Time Reference:** UTC only
- **Serialization:** Canonical JSON
- **Encoding:** UTF-8

Any deviation invalidates Canon compliance.

---

## 4. System Roles (Canonical)

### 4.1 Submitter
- Registers data into the system
- Signs submissions cryptographically
- Bears responsibility for data correctness
- May be individual, enterprise, or institution

### 4.2 Verifier
- Verifies certificates offline
- Requires no permission or account
- Uses Merkle proofs and signatures only
- Does not trust infrastructure or submitter

### 4.3 Auditor
- Inspects epochs and manifests
- Validates append-only integrity
- Confirms Canon adherence
- Does not access raw data by default

---

## 5. Canonical Guarantees

FORGED-LRO guarantees the following **by design**:

### 5.1 Append-Only Ledger
- No UPDATE
- No DELETE
- No overwrite
- History is immutable

### 5.2 Epoch Anchoring
- Entries grouped into fixed-size epochs
- Each epoch produces:
  - Merkle root
  - Ed25519 signature
- Epochs are chained forward-only

### 5.3 Offline Verifiability
- Verification does not require:
  - Network access
  - Server availability
  - Trusted third parties

### 5.4 Zero-Opinion Principle
- The system certifies **state**, not meaning
- No truth, legality, intent, or value is asserted
- Interpretation is strictly external

---

## 6. Vertical Neutrality

The Canon is **vertical-agnostic**.

Invoices, documents, supply chains, AI logs, or any other vertical:

- Must conform to the same Canon
- Cannot alter core invariants
- Cannot introduce hidden semantics

All verticals are extensions, never exceptions.

---

## 7. Change Control

This Canon is **frozen**.

Any modification requires:

- A new Canon version (v1.1, v2.0, etc.)
- Forward-only applicability
- No retroactive effect
- Explicit version declaration

Silent or implicit changes are forbidden.

---

## 8. Integrity Statement (Binding)

Any implementation, service, or product that:

- Violates this Canon, or
- Alters its invariants, or
- Introduces contradictory behavior

**MUST NOT** claim FORGED-LRO or RVA compliance.

Non-compliance is binary.

---

## 9. Authority

This Canon governs:

- FORGED-LRO Core
- Reality Validation Authority (RVA)
- All present and future verticals

There is no parallel authority.

---

## 10. End of Canon

**FORGED-LRO — Canon v1.0**  
**Status:** Frozen  
**Effective:** 2026-01-10
